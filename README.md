# Lost And Found
This is a game I made using Unreal Engine 5.

Hope you like it because I put a looot of effort into this.
Still, it's far from perfect, but I've got to learn a lot of new stuff.

Most of the code is written in C++, so it was very fun!

## Plot
A boy who loved reading comics was sent to an another world! 🌎

It has monsters and the citizens are suffering... 😢

They ask the young hero for help and he decides to help them, of course. 😎

He grabs the sword and goes straight into the battle!⚔️💥

Eliminate the enemies and save the citizens from another world!🤩
